Will need:

#####jQuery

Will listen to keyup events and convert the typed key 
into the equivalent Colemak key. 

After that it will push that key to an array and then 
draw the array every time a key has been put in.

Possible helper functions:

- grab last pressed letter and append to array
- draw array based on hash with key value pairs
- search hash and match keys with wanted keys
